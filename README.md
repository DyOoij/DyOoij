# Heya folks! 👋

🙋‍♂️ I am a self taught programming hobbyist who likes to mess around in Python and, more recently, C++  
Boundlessly curious and eager to learn new concepts while trying to deepen my understanding of the ones I already know.

- 🌱 Currently trying to get to grips with C++ in order to better understand what is actually happening at a lower level 
- 🔭 Currently using aforementioned C++ to rewrite a Python project, using it as a framework to understand and learn the language through
- ⚡ I will happily spend a few of my nerves and many, many hours hacksawing a solution together if it means I get to understand what goes on under the hood, rather than grab a neatly packaged solution from elsewhere
- 📨 Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylan-ooijevaar-01752015a/)


## ⚙️ Languages
  ### Python
  - Several years of small projects done in the spirit of "I wonder if it'll work like this" that then grow into small programming nightmares
  ### C++
  - In an attempt to better understand what actually goes on at a lower level I have recently decided to pick up C++ and I'm currently actively learning the language
